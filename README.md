# droutine
A better coroutine wrapper for Lua, written by Daniel R. Koris

DRoutine provides a container for a regular Lua coroutine. This gives us all the functionality of a regular coroutine
plus the advantages of being able to call the coroutine like a "wrapped" corountine in lua that looses a lot of
the regular coroutine's goodies.
